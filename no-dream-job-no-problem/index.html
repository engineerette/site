<p>Navigating in hustle culture is tricky when you don’t love your jobs. It’s important to look after yourself. 
There are a few paths forward:</p>

<h4 id="1-fake-the-passion">1. Fake the passion</h4>
<p>There are plenty of companies that will pay you big bucks to work on something you might not believe in. Some of these companies also go hard on selling the corporate Kool-Aid. If you don’t openly express loving your work, you aren’t getting promoted.</p>

<p>Feigning enthusiasm can be quite soul-crushing, but you may feel tempted to tough it out if the practical benefits are worth it.

<p>Realizing you hate your job is a hard pill to swallow. Changing your situation is an even bigger hurdle to get over. Change is scary, thus many jobs are called “golden handcuffs”.

However, experiences and skills are actually quite transferable, as long as you spin them the right way!</p>

<p>No job is worth your mental health.  If you dread showing up for work every day and daydream about “what-ifs”, maybe it’s time to make a move to something you’ll like a bit more.</p>

<p>If you don’t have a clue what your next move should be, don’t sweat it! The goal should be to do something you <em>don’t</em> hate. Ask yourself, “what aspects of your current role do you dislike?”, and work from there.</p>

<p>Finding a career you can work with can be an iterative process, and we should recognize it as so. Let’s start by shedding the false perception of “instantly clicking” and falling in love with a dream job.</p>
